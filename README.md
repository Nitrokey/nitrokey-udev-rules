# Nitrokey udev Rules

This repository contains udev rules for Nitrokey devices.
Previously, these rules were maintained as a part of [libnitrokey][].

[libnitrokey]: https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey

## Usage and Requirements

The [`41-nitrokey.rules`][] file contains udev rules for these devices:
- Nitrokey 3
- Nitrokey HSM
- Nitrokey FIDO U2F
- Nitrokey FIDO2
- Nitrokey Pro
- Nitrokey Storage
- Nitrokey Start
- Nitrokey U2F

[`41-nitrokey.rules`]: ./41-nitrokey.rules

It requires udev 188 or later.
For older udev versions, use the [`41-nitrokey_old.rules`][] from libnitrokey.

[`41-nitrokey_old.rules`]: https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey/blob/master/data/41-nitrokey_old.rules

The rules use the `uaccess` tag which is a systemd mechanism.

To install the rules file, place it in `/etc/udev/rules.d`.
The file prefix should be lower than 73 because the rules must be applied before udevâ€™s `73-seat-late.rules`.
